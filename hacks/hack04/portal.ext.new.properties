    # viewed by users in many different languages.
    #
    # Set this to 1 if the locale is automatically prepended to a URL when the
    # requested locale is not the default locale. This means that each URL
    # points to just one language. For example, the URL

    # The URL http://localhost:8080/zh/web/guest/home and
    # http://localhost:8080/zh_CN/web/guest/home would both point to the Chinese
    # language.
    #
    # In cases where the prepended locale is "zh" and not the complete locale
    # "zh_CN", then the full locale returned will be based on the order in which
    # the locales appear in the property "locales". If "zh_CN" appears before
    # "zh_TW", then "zh" will be a short hand for "zh_TW".

    # requested locale is not the default user locale. In the case of guest
    # users, the behavior is the same as having a value of 1.

    # to view that page, then the rule set by the property
    # "auth.forward.by.last.path" will apply.
    #
    # You can set the redirect manually from another application by appending
    # the "redirect" parameter in a url that looks like this:
    # /c/portal/login?redirect=%2Fgroup%2Femployees%2Fcalendar. This url will

## Buffered Increment
##

    #
    # The standby properties manage the time the dispatcher waits to process an
    # increment requests. The longer the dispatcher waits to process a request,
    # the greater the probability that incoming requests, involving the same
    # entity instances (entries), can be batched together.
    #
    # For example, if the same Message Boards thread (MBThread instance) is
    # viewed multiple times (n times) while an existing view increment request
    # for that MBThread is waiting to be dispatched, then the incoming
    # increments can be added to the increment value of the existing request.
    # The resulting view count increment for the existing entry then would be
    # modified to 1 + n times and the incoming requests would be discarded. This
    # minimizes the database hits for incrementing that entry. Since the
    # incoming requests were no longer needed, and hence discarded, the memory
    # required for incrementing the view count of the entry was minimized too.
    #
    # Worker threads submit new increment requests to a BatchablePipe and notify
    # the dispatcher thread pool of the requests. The pipe acts as a mailbox
    # holding increment requests in a queue for the dispatcher to process. On
    # receiving a new increment request, the pipe checks if it already has a
    # request for the same entry. If it does, the pipe adds the incoming
    # increment to the existing entry's increment value and discards the
    # incoming increment request. If it doesn't find an existing request for the
    # same entry, the incoming request is simply added to the tail of the queue.
    #
    # On being notified by the worker thread of increment requests submitted to
    # the BatchablePipe, the thread pool checks the status of its dispatch
    # threads. If no dispatch threads exist, it creates one. If an idle thread
    # exists, it wakes it up. If threads exist but they are all active, the
    # thread pool leaves them alone. Active dispatch threads check the pipe's
    # queue for requests to process.
    #
    # The dispatch threads apply the standby logic before processing each
    # request from the pipe. They calculate the standby time for the request at
    # the head of the pipe's queue based on the queue threshold. If the number
    # of requests in the queue exceeds the threshold, the dispatch thread
    # processes the head request as quickly as possible, without waiting. If the
    # number of requests is within the threshold, the dispatch thread calculates
    # the standby time for the head request to be the standby time upper limit
    # (in seconds) divided by the number of requests in the queue. The fewer
    # requests in the queue, the longer the head request waits on standby.
    #
    # Consider the tradeoff between overall performance and delay in view count
    # updates as you configure standby waiting. The standby times applied to
    # the requests have a linear inverse ratio relationship to the number of
    # requests in the pipe. The standby time is not constant. The fewer requests
    # inside the queue, the longer they wait in standby. This logic increases
    # the probability of maximizing the batching of requests for dispatch. The
    # following chart illustrates the relationship:
    #
    #     ^ standby time
    #     |
    #     |\<---buffered.increment.standby.time.upper.limit
    #     | \
    #     |  \
    #     |   \
    #     |    \
    #     --------------> current BatchablePipe size
    #     0 ^
    #       |
    #       buffered.increment.standby.queue.threshold
    #
    # Typical settings for the queue threshold and upper time limit of a heavy
    # loaded system could be 10000 requests and 60 seconds, respectively.
    #
    # If either the queue threshold or upper time limit are set to 0, requests
    # are processed from the queue as quickly as possible, without waiting.
    # Negative values for either property are treated as 0.
